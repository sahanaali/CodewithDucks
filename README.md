# Code with Ducks
Acquired by Stevens Institute of Technology 

The Code with Ducks project, in collaboration with team member Johan Nguyen, focused on designing an app and website aimed at teaching underrepresented high school students about Python programming, machine learning, and AI. The project is now part of the STEP (Student Development & Enrichment Programs) at Stevens Institute of Technology and will be managed by Dr. Edlyn Thompson-Mettle, Director of the High School Enrichment Program.

In this project, I designed the UI/UX experience for the app, creating wireframes and mockups in Figma. The website provides an overview of the Code with Ducks program, featuring the landing page, program details, statistics, curriculum overview, instructors, and team members. I developed Figma prototypes for these pages, prioritizing user engagement through interactive elements like animations and responsive designs. The use of primary colors, gradients, and transparency creates a unique and eye-catching design while maintaining accessibility and ease of use for all users.

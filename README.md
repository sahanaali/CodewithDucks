# Code with Ducks
Acquired by Stevens Institute of Technology 

The Code with Ducks project, in collaboration with team member Johan Nguyen, focused on designing an app and website aimed at teaching underrepresented high school students about Python programming, machine learning, and AI. The project is now part of the STEP (Student Development & Enrichment Programs) at Stevens Institute of Technology and will be managed by Dr. Edlyn Thompson-Mettle, Director of the High School Enrichment Program.

In this project, I designed the UI/UX experience for the app, creating wireframes and mockups in Figma. The app showcases a personalized learning journey with features such as dashboards, login pages, progress tracking, and questionnaires. I developed Figma prototypes for these pages, focusing on user engagement by incorporating interactive elements like animations and responsive designs.

Additionally, I designed a website for a non-profit organization, providing UI design to support the non-profit's mission. I worked on both low-fidelity (lo-fi) and high-fidelity (hi-fi) wireframes to guide the development of the UI in Next.js, ensuring the designs were accessible, interactive, and engaging for users
